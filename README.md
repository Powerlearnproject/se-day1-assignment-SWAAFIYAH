# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
//answer
Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
//answer
writing machine level codes
Introduction to  structured codes like the object oriented programming
Intoduction to the agile methodology



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
//answer
Planning  and documentation- defining what the application is about its scope ,its budget and its flow from start to end.
Designing - Drawing designs to represent the frontal look of the application that user is going to interact with.
Implementation - writing codes in order to transfer these designs into a real i teractive application
Testing - Conducting test to see if your application is vulnerable to security attacks.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
//comparison between agile and waterfall
agile                                                                                      waterfall
Plannning is done continually as the development i going on                             Planning is comprehensively first before any developement takes place
Developement goes bit by bit and testing each MVP before coding the next                 whole developement takes place and testing happens only when development is over
Used in very complex and big application                                                 Suitable for small and simple applications

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
//answer
Software developer - responsible for writing codes to produce a functional application
Quality assuarance Engineer - Responsible for ensuring the codes written are of quality and application is safe for use and meets the expectations
Project Manager - Responsible for ensuring projects are complited in time and requirements are met.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
//answer
IDEs provide an environment where developer can write test and debug there codes.it has intergrated  tools that simplify the process of development example of IDE is android studio
Version Control System is a system that enables developer to store his code remotely so even if a machine happens to break down he is sure to still get his code back
it also manages and tracks every changes which are made to the codes
it allows developers to work as a team by enabling collaboration among them.example is git and github.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
//answer
Understanding the requirements
Debuging
//strategies
making sure client gives you a clear requirement document
write codes in IDEs for they can show you where exactly the error is.
Use logs.they tell you the specific error
use Ai tools they help in identifying the cause of the error.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
//answer
unit - testing each functionality  in an application independently
intergration - testing functionalities that depend on each other to achieve the requirement.
system - testing the full system
accepting - Ensuring the entire system meets the expectations


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
//answer
The act of giving instructions  interms of questions to an Ai tool so that it can giv you useful clear and understandable outputs
//importance
it makes life easy by giving you solutions that you could not even think of.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt - "How to develope an application"
improved prompt - "How to develope a mobile application  using flutter"
